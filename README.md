## 🧠 Inspiration
Financial literacy is often inaccessible, impersonal, or overwhelming. At the same time, history is filled with individuals who built wealth, overcame adversity, and developed timeless financial philosophies.

This project bridges that gap by transforming financial education into an immersive, narrative-driven experience — where users don’t just learn concepts, but engage with the minds that shaped them.
